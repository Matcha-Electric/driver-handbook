## Matcha's Code of Conduct  :tea:

Welcome to the  world of EV charging, where we all come together to power up our clean, fast, and quiet rides. Here's a little guide to help us share the space and keep the positive vibrations.

### **1. Sharing is Caring**
Remember, charging spots are like the last slice of pizza at a party ‚Äì very sought after! If you're done charging, kindly move your vehicle so someone else can get their turn. It‚Äôs all about giving everyone a slice of the power pie.

### **2. Be a Timekeeper**
We've all got places to be, adventures to embark on! If there's a time limit posted, let's stick to it. Be respectful of the next user and move your car as soon as your charge is completed.

### **3. Keep it Tidy**
Treat the charging area like your home. Park in the lines, keep cables neat, and if you see trash, consider giving it a lift to the nearest bin. A little sprucing up makes the space welcoming for the next person.

### **4. Friendly Faces**
Spot another EV pilot? A smile or a nod goes a long way. We‚Äôre all part of this electric dream, so let's spread some cheer. Who knows? You might make a new friend or learn a new EV tip!

### **5. Lend a Hand**
If you see someone having trouble with a charger or a first-timer looking a bit lost, offer a helping hand if you can. Sharing tips or lending a bit of expertise builds a supportive community.

### **6. Spread the Word**
Encountered a glitch with the equipment? Pass the word along to the service provider or the station manager. Your heads-up could help fix the issue faster, making charging smoother for everyone.

### **7. Patience is a Virtue**
Sometimes, all spots are taken, or a charger might be on the fritz. It‚Äôs a bummer, but hang in there! Patience and flexibility can turn a minor hiccup into just another part of the adventure.

### **And There You Have It!**
Just a few simple tips to keep the charging experience awesome for everyone. Thanks for being part of this electrifying community. Let‚Äôs keep rolling forward, sharing the spark, and making the world a little greener, one charge at a time!

Safe travels and happy charging, friends! üåç
