# Matcha Billing

Matcha has two different billing processes: one for members, and one for pay-as-you-go customers

## 1. Member Billing

Members will be billed *once per month*, usually in the first few days of the month for all charges incurred in the previous month. The payment method you added when you signed up will be charged, and you will receive an itemized receipt of the previous month's activity.

## 2. Pay-As-You-Go (non member) Billing

Non members will be billed after the completion of *each* charging session, usually within a few hours of ending the session. The payment method you added when you signed up will be charged, and you will receive an itemized receipt of the session.

### *Notifications (_Coming Soon_)

In the near future, Matcha will rollout a new feature that allows you to setup notifications for your active charging sessions. In addition to in-app monitoring of your charging progress, Matcha will push you email and/or text notifications alerting you when your charge is started, complete, and other important notifications.
