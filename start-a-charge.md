# How To Start Charging

There are currently two ways to start charging at a Matcha charger: using your RFID card, if you're a member; or scanning the QR code on the charge station. _Note: Both require that you've created a Matcha user account and added a payment method._

## 1. Matcha RFID Card

If you've signed up for a Matcha Membership Plan, you may have received a Matcha RFID card. Using your RFID card is the fastest and easiest way to start a charge. Simply *tap your card at the station*, wait for the indicator light to flash green, plug-in and your charge will start automatically.

## 2. QR Code on the Charge Station

When you arrive at a charge station, use your smartphone to *scan the QR code on that station*. This will bring you to a unique web page for that charger. Double check the Charge Station ID, click the _Start Charging_ button, wait for the indicator light to flash green, plug-in and your charge will start automatically. _Note: If you're not already logged into your user account, then the web app will ask you to login first._ 

## 3. Find a Charger in the App (_Coming Soon_)
