# How to Create a Matcha User Account

If you're new to the _Matcha_ ecosystem, **the first step** is to create a Matcha user account. This will give you the ability to access chargers, save a payment method for quick-start charging, monitor active charge sessions in real-time, receive notifications, find a charger, view your charge history, and many other features that enhance the user experience. 

The sign-up process is straightforward, and takes less than 3 minutes. 

## 1. Create Your Username and Password

Use [this link](https://app.matchaelectric.com/signup) to sign-up for a new Matcha user account. Enter your name, email, and password, review the terms of use, and click the _Sign-up_ button.

## 2. Enter Your Address and Setup a Payment Method

Enter your address and click the _Next_ button. Enter a payment method and click _Submit_. This is the payment method that will be used to bill any fees associated with the use of a Matcha charger. 

_Note: We use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for secure payment processing and never store your payment information on our servers._

## 3. Your Finished! 

At the end of the sign-up process, you'll land inside the Matcha app. It'll be pretty empty in there since you haven't charged yet, but now you're ready to [Start a Charge](https://github.com/Matcha-Electric/manual/blob/main/start-a-charge.md)!
