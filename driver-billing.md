# Matcha Billing

Matcha has two different billing processes: one for members, and one for pay-as-you-go customers

## 1. Member Billing

Members will be billed *once per month*, usually in the first few days of the month for all charges incurred in the previous month. The payment method you added when you signed up will be charged, and you will receive an itemized receipt of the previous month's activity. Remember, you can always [login to the Matcha app](https://app.matchaelectric.com/signin) and go to Charge History to view your sessions costs even before your monthly billing cycle.

## 2. Pay-As-You-Go (non member) Billing

Non-members will be billed *after the completion of each charging session*, usually within a few hours of ending the session. The payment method you added when you signed up will be charged, and you will receive an itemized receipt of the session.

#### Note: Matcha uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for safe and secure payments. We never store your personal payment information.
