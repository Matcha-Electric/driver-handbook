# How To Start Charging

There are currently 2 ways to start charging at a _Matcha_ charger: using your RFID card (if you're a member); or scanning the QR code on the charge station. _Note: Both require that you've [created a Matcha user account](https://github.com/Matcha-Electric/manual/blob/main/create-a-user-account.md) and added a payment method._

## 1. Tap Your Matcha RFID Card

If you've signed up for a Matcha Membership Plan, you may have received a Matcha RFID card. Using your RFID card is the fastest and easiest way to start a charge. Simply **tap your card at the station**, wait for the indicator light on the charger to flash green, plug-in, and your charge will start automatically.

## 2. Scan the QR Code on the Charger

When you arrive at a charge station, use your smartphone to **scan the QR code on that station**. This will open a web page for that charger. Double check the Charge Station ID, click the _Start Charging_ button, wait for the indicator light on the charger to flash green, plug-in, and your charge will start automatically. _Note: If you're not already logged into your user account the web app will ask you to login first._ 

After you've started your charge session, you can use the Matcha app to [monitor your active charge session](https://github.com/Matcha-Electric/manual/blob/main/monitor-your-charge-session.md) from your smartphone.

### *Find a Charger in the App (_Coming Soon_)

In the near future, Matcha will rollout a new feature that allows you to search for a charger in the Matcha app, select that charger, and then start a charge session. This will work similar to the QR code method (above) but give you the ability to look up the charger in the app instead of scanning the QR code.
