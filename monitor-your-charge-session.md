# How to Monitor Your Charging Session

After you've [created a Matcha user account](https://github.com/Matcha-Electric/manual/blob/main/create-a-user-account.md) and [started charging](https://github.com/Matcha-Electric/manual/blob/main/start-a-charge.md), you can monitor your active charge session in real-time from your smartphone (or any web browser). Grab a snack, read a book, take a nap and check your charging progress from your phone!

## 1. If you're already logged in to your Matcha account

If you're already logged into the Matcha app, simply click on the _Home_ button on the lefthand menu and the default display will be your active charge session. The data for a live session will update approximately every 5 minutes.  

## 2. If you're not logged into your Matcha account

If you're not logged into the Matcha app, simply [login to your account](https://app.matchaelectric.com/signin) and the default landing home page display will be your active charge session. The data for a live session will update approximately every 5 minutes.

### *Notifications (_Coming Soon_)

In the near future, Matcha will rollout a new feature that allows you to setup notifications for your active charging sessions. In addition to in-app monitoring of your charging progress, Matcha will push you email and/or text notifications alerting you when your charge is started, complete, and other important notifications.
